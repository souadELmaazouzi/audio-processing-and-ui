Dataset Name:
Human vs Loudspeaker Speech Dataset (0m & 3m)

Description:
This dataset was created to study the impact of loudspeaker playback on
automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance, following the protocol
inspired by recent works based on Whisper models.

The dataset contains paired recordings of:
- Direct human speech (natural speech)
- Speech replayed through a loudspeaker at two distances (0 m and 3 m)

The goal is to analyze acoustic distortions introduced by loudspeaker
playback and distance, and their effect on ASR transcription accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------
Recording Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------
- Number of sentences: 20 (fixed and predefined)
- Speaker: 1 human speaker
- Recording device: smartphone microphone (standard quality)
- Loudspeaker: consumer loudspeaker
- Distances:
  • Human (direct speech)
  • Loudspeaker at 0 meters
  • Loudspeaker at 3 meters
- Environment:
  • Quiet indoor room
  • Minimal background noise
- Sampling rate: 16 kHz
- Audio format: WAV (lossless)

Each sentence was recorded three times:
1) Spoken directly by the human speaker
2) Played through the loudspeaker at 0 meters
3) Played through the loudspeaker at 3 meters

Metadata:
--------------------------------------------------
The file metadata.csv contains, for each recording:
- file_name: name of the audio file
- sentence_id: sentence index (1–20)
- text: transcription of the sentence
- speaker_type: human / speaker
- distance_m: 0 or 3 (meters)
- environment: indoor
- sample_rate: 16000

--------------------------------------------------
Intended Use:
--------------------------------------------------
- Evaluation of ASR robustness to loudspeaker playback
- Comparison between natural and replayed speech
- Fine-tuning or testing Whisper-based ASR models
- Educational and research purposes

--------------------------------------------------
Notes:
--------------------------------------------------
- The dataset is intentionally small-scale due to time constraints.
- The protocol is designed to be reproducible and extendable.
- This dataset serves as a controlled experimental contribution
  complementary to existing large-scale datasets.
